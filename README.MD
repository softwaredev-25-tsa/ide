## Getting started
Before cloning the repo make sure you have the correct dependices   
You should have npm and node [installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)   
Run these commands to get started after cloning the repo

## Usage
In order to send a file you must first log in to the server   
Create an account if you don't already have one   
The current code in the editor is what will be sent so there's no need to save before hand
